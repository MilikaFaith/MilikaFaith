## Hi, I’m Milika Faith 👋   

I’m a **data analyst and business administration professional** with over 4 years of experience in business operations and management. My journey into analytics began after completing a **BSc in Statistics and Programming**, when I was thrust into the business world and quickly realized the power of data beyond numbers.

What started as curiosity grew into a passion for understanding patterns, asking better questions, and translating data into insights that support real-world business decisions. I’m driven by the process of uncovering stories hidden in data and using them to guide growth, efficiency, and meaningful business transformation.

## 🛠 My Tech Stack includes;
+ SQL
+ PowerBI
+ Tableau
+ Excel

## ⭐Currently Working on;
I’m currently building toward the launch of a Data Literacy firm focused on equipping and empowering businesses,particularly SMEs to confidently adopt a data-driven culture.

Many organizations find today’s data landscape intimidating and overly complex due to gaps in understanding. My goal is to simplify data, build internal capability, and help businesses gain the confidence to make informed, data-backed decisions that support long-term growth.
